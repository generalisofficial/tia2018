[h1]Compatible HOI4 Version: 1.12.11[/h1]
[h1]Compatible Languages: English[/h1]

TIA 2018 aims to become an immersive geopolitical simulator starting in 2018, aiming to balance sandbox and realism. The mod is heavily inspired by Geopolitical Simulator 4: Power & Revolution, and will introduce advanced political and economic mechanics, dynamic events, geographical changes, reworked graphics and more.
TIA 2018 also completely removes the national focus tree mechanic, instead aiming to replace their function with interactive mechanics, decisions, events and other gameplay functions. The focus tree mechanic is simply too linear and restrictive for what this mod is trying to become. TIA 2018 is a mod of innovation, meaning that we are ready to think outside the box, and embrace ideas that no other mod has ever done.

TIA 2018 is the flagship project of the TIA Development Studio.

[*]ALL features listed are currently WIP (Work-in-progress), meaning that they are all subject to possible bugs and incomplete aspects.
[*]It is not recommended to use other mods at the same time as this one. Ask on the mod's Discord server if you want to know if a specific mod is compatible with TIA 2018.
[*]Make sure to be using DirectX 9 in the launcher, or 3D models may start breaking or glitching.
[*]Do not use "set_ruling_party" to change governments as that breaks the parliament and government systems. You can instead use "add_party_popularity" and use the command "event election.5".
[*]Most country tags align with the ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 index, but for those that do not, use command "tdebug".
