 ENG_INFORMATION_AGE_DESC: "Rule Britannia, Britannia rules the waves. This was the rallying cry of many Britons in the days gone by, but the era of the indomitable Royal Navy projecting power across the globe has long since been over. Save for a few small desolate islands strewn about the forgotten corners of the globe, the British Empire has come to an indisputable end. The spirit of Churchill and Thatcher have been replaced by the ever uncharismatic likes of Prime Minister Theresa May and Opposition Leader Jeremy Corbyn, leaving an increasingly divided “Nation of Nations” to find its way through the brave new world it finds itself in. Now comes the question on every British mind: What now? This is a dilemma that has been provided many possible answers by Tories, Socialists, and Liberals alike. To some the United Kingdom is a relic of the past, a modern Austria-Hungary not long for the world and only serving to hold down their local region. To others Britain is another part of the Europe that they call home, whether they be urban liberals or one of the many thousands of recent arrivals from all over the continent. Yet others believe that Britain is more than a mere Frankenstein’s monster of Englishmen, Welshmen, and Scots. They believe that Britain is wholly separate from any greater “European” identity and that Britain must return to the global stage not tied down by any foreign interests in Washington or Brussels.\n\nThis crisis of identity has finally come to a head in the form of \"“Brexit”\". Initially a simple referendum proposed as a ploy by then-PM David Cameron to win over Eurosceptic voters in the 2015 Elections, it soon spiraled into the all-encompassing crisis of Theresa May’s administration. The decision by the slim majority of the British public to withdraw from the European Union has revived questions on Scottish and Irish nationalism as well as trade policy, in addition to sending investors into a constant state of uncertainty. May was unlucky enough to have the task of guiding Britain through a turbulent withdrawal, but after poor showings in her recent snap election many even in her own party are beginning to look for an alternative leader. There’s no end in sight and every day that solutions are not being made is another day Britain’s prospects grow darker. Will Britain stagger out of Brexit, or will this be the crisis that spells doom for the fragile union?\n\nMay God save the Queen and God save Britannia, for it's beginning to look like no one else can."

 GER_INFORMATION_AGE_DESC: "Unity. Justice. Freedom. These are the values on which the new German state is built. Or perhaps it is more accurate to say rebuilt. Indeed, the modern Federal Republic of Germany is a nation built upon the ashes of darker and more sinister iterations of the Vaterland. The Modern Germany stands for the unity that was robbed of it with the division of 1949 and cemented with the erection of the Berlin Wall. It stands for justice, the same that the National Socialists had denied to it’s countless victims. It stands for freedom, that flaming torch which the Führer and the General Secretary had so desperately attempted to suffocate. But these values have become evermore difficult to maintain in the Information Era as the ever-shifting political seas continue their course. As the old parties age and are increasingly seen as corrupt and incompetent, people have begun to turn to more extreme alternatives. The twin forces of Die Linke and the AfD have arisen in the East as spectres of the past, appealing to the many disaffected Germans angry that they can’t receive as good an education or the same quality of living as their western counterparts, angry that as the East gets poorer, the West gets richer. While the establishment has so far weathered the storm under the popular Angela Merkel, even this required them to band together and forge a new Grand Coalition in 2017 with the AfD serving as official opposition. Time will tell whether this is a tenable arrangement..\n\nThe 20th Century was not kind to the Vaterland. But after two devastating wars, a depression, and a 40-year division of the country Germany now stands once more as Europe’s largest economy. It stands as a champion of the European Union, and German influence is beginning to once more be felt all over the globe. But this position is by no means secure. The economic gap between the former East and West continues to grow. The Migrant Crisis has only fuelled anti-democratic sentiment, and the European Union is increasingly beset by the rising tide of populism that has swept the continent, threatening to undo the great European Experiment. Looking outwards, the Russian Bear once again threatens the continent, the Chinese Dragon seeks superpower status, and the American Eagle seems content to slowly return to isolationism. The stage is set for Germany to either gather the bickering democracies of Europe and lead them to prosperity, or watch helplessly as it becomes subject to the whims of Moscow and Beijing..\n\nWill the Vaterland endure the Information Age? Or will the dark domestic and foreign themes of the previous century once more rear their ugly heads?"
