 motorized_rocket_equipment_short:0 "Mot. R. Artillery"
 motorized_rocket_equipment_desc:0 "Multiple rocket launchers such as these deliver explosives to a target area more quickly than conventional artillery, but with lower accuracy and requiring a longer time to reload. Being mounted on trucks, this version is able to launch attacks and change positions before the enemy can return fire."

 rocket_artillery_equipment_desc:0 "Rocket artillery is a type of artillery which utilizes rockets as a projectile. Modern rocket artillery was first employed during World War II, in the form of the German Nebelwerfer family of rocket ordnance designs, Soviet Katyusha-series and numerous other systems employed on a smaller scale by the Western allies and Japan. In modern use, the rockets are often guided by an internal guiding system or GPS in order to maintain accuracy."

 anti_tank_equipment_short:0 "Anti-Tank"
 anti_tank_equipment_desc:0 "Man-portable anti-tank systems (MANPATS or MPATS) are shoulder-launched anti-tank rockets. Modern MANPATS have their roots in the 20th century with the early development of the explosive shaped charge. The development of practical rocketry provided a means of delivering such an explosive."

 anti_tank_equipment_2_short:0 "Gen 2 MANPATS"
 anti_tank_equipment_2_desc:0 "The standard missile tube has been ruggedized along with the designation system. The controls are more intuitive and feature a top-attack mode, exploiting the weak top armor of most modern tanks."
 anti_tank_equipment_3:0 "Advanced AT"
 anti_tank_equipment_3_short:0 "Gen 3 MANPATS"
 anti_tank_equipment_3_desc:0 "A more basic recoilless rifle with modern optics for more accurate fire. The ammunition used by this system may vary depending on the role."
 anti_tank_equipment_4:0 "Near-Future AT"
 anti_tank_equipment_4_short:0 "Gen 4 MANPATS"
 anti_tank_equipment_4_desc:0 "A significantly updated missile system featuring top attack and direct modes of fire. The size has been reduced without diminishing the destructive power of the missile itself."
 anti_tank_equipment_5:0 "Future AT"
 anti_tank_equipment_5_short:0 "Gen 5 MANPATS"
 anti_tank_equipment_5_desc:0 "The most advanced man-portable anti-tank system in production. This features the standard top attack and direct fire modes, but also features a loitering mode. The loitering mode forces the missile to fly to higher altitudes and circle the battlefield until a target has been designated. Loitering allows ground forces to reduce exposure when designating a target by using lock-on after launch with a large window of time."
