The act expanded surveillance abilities of law enforcement, including by tapping domestic and international phones, easier interagency communication to allow federal agencies to more effectively use all available resources in counterterrorism efforts and increased penalties for terrorism crimes and an expanded list of activities which would qualify for terrorism charges.\n\nThe law is controversial due to its authorization of indefinite detention without trial of immigrants, and due to the permission given to law enforcement to search property and records without a warrant, consent, or knowledge."
