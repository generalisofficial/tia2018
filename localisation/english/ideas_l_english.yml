The amendment is a constant cause of conflict within American politics as to its totality - with the government having successfully banned private ownership of weapons like heavy machine guns and land mines in the past, which some activists believe to be infringing upon the Second Amendment.\n\nThe Second Amendment leads to unfortunate situations where a few of the gun owners abuse their weapons to do harm, forcing the government to focus on cleaning up school shootings, hostage situations, gang crime and robberies instead of trying to bring the country forward."

 #Belgium
