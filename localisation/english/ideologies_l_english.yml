 socialist_with_chinese_characteristics_desc: "Party Subideology: §0Socialism with Chinese Characteristics§!\n\nSocialism with Chinese characteristics is a set of political theories and policies of the Communist Party of China that are seen by their proponents as representing Marxism–Leninism adapted to Chinese circumstances and specific time periods, including Deng Xiaoping Theory, Three Represents (Jiang Zemin), Scientific Outlook on Development (Hu Jintao), and Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era. In this view, Xi Jinping Thought is considered to represent Marxist–Leninist policies suited for China's present condition while Deng Xiaoping Theory was considered relevant for the period when it was formulated.\n\nThe term entered common usage during the era of Deng Xiaoping and was largely associated with Deng's overall program of adopting elements of market economics as a means to foster growth using foreign investment and to increase productivity while the CPC retained both its formal commitment to achieve communism and its monopoly on political power. The theory stipulated that China was in the primary stage of socialism due to its relatively low level of material wealth and needed to engage in economic growth before it pursued a more egalitarian form of socialism, which in turn would lead to a communist society described in Marxist orthodoxy."
