 patrol_boat:0 "Patrol Boat"
 patrol_boat_desc:0 "A patrol boat (also referred to as a patrol craft, patrol ship or patrol vessel) is a relatively small naval vessel generally designed for coastal defence, border protection, immigration law-enforcement, search and rescue duties. They may be broadly classified as inshore patrol vessels (IPVs) or offshore patrol vessels (OPVs). They are warships typically smaller in size than a corvette and can include fast attack craft, torpedo boats and missile boats, although some are as large as a frigate."

 destroyer:0 "Corvette"
 destroyer_desc:0 "A corvette is a small warship. It is traditionally the smallest class of vessel considered to be a proper warship. Modern navies began a trend in the late 20th and early 21st centuries towards smaller, more manoeuvrable surface capability. They are usually armed with medium- and small-caliber guns, surface-to-surface missiles, surface-to-air missiles, and antisubmarine weapons. Many can accommodate a small or medium antisubmarine warfare helicopter."

 heavy_cruiser_desc:0 "A large armored cruiser that is pretty flexible. A good choice for nations who can't afford to build larger capital ships."
 both_cruisers_desc:0 "A frigate is a type of warship, having various sizes and roles over the last few centuries. In modern navies, frigates are used to protect other warships and merchant-marine ships, especially as anti-submarine warfare (ASW) combatants for amphibious expeditionary forces, underway replenishment groups, and merchant convoys.\n\nIn naval terminology, a destroyer is a fast, maneuverable, long-endurance warship intended to escort larger vessels in a fleet, convoy or battle group and defend them against smaller powerful short-range attackers. At the start of the 21st century, destroyers are the global standard for surface combatant ships. "

In the later 20th century, the obsolescence of the battleship left the cruiser as the largest and most powerful surface combatant after the aircraft carrier. The role of the cruiser varied according to ship and navy, often including air defense and shore bombardment."
