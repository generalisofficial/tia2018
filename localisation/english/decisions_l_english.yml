 integrate_state: "Integrate §m[FROM.GetName]§!"
 integrate_state_desc: "We currently control §m[FROM.GetName]§!, a territory with a permanent population, but one that hasn't been fully integrated into our realm. By establishing a functioning administrative structure and neutralizing any armed resistance to our rule, §m[FROM.GetName]§! can be just as [ROOT.GetAdjective] as our capital city."
 settle_state: "Settle §m[FROM.GetName]§!"
 settle_state_desc: "We currently control §m[FROM.GetName]§!, a territory which currently lacks any kind of permanent population, putting a dent in our plans to fully integrate the territory into our realm and establish a functioning local economy. By constructing basic infrastructure and sending 2500 [ROOT.GetAdjective] settlers from our capital region, §m[FROM.GetName]§! will no longer be an unpopulated wasteland."

 #Brexit
 brexit_decisions: "Brexit"
 brexit_decisions_desc: "Brexit is the impending withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. It follows the referendum of 23 June 2016 when 51.9 percent of those who voted supported withdrawal. Withdrawal has been advocated by Eurosceptics, both left-wing and right-wing, while Pro-Europeanists, who also span the political spectrum, have advocated continued membership."
 brexit_countdown: "Withdraw Article 50"
 brexit_countdown_desc: "Unless another solution to the EU question is reached before the 30th of March 2019, the United Kingdom will withdraw permanently from the European Union. If a trade deal has been reached before then, it will be a so-called Soft Brexit. If not, it will be a Hard Brexit, significantly impacting our economy due to the shock of the withdrawal."
 propose_brexit_trade_agreement: "Propose Brexit Trade Agreement"
 propose_brexit_trade_agreement_desc: "If we are going to achieve this so-called Soft Brexit, we need to negotiate a trade deal with the European Union. Such a deal would allow us to stay in the European Common Market, but allow us to leave the political union. Let's draw it up and send it to the European Council for a vote."
 second_brexit_referendum: "Second Brexit Referendum"
 second_brexit_referendum_desc: "With a deal for a Soft Brexit not yet reached, another option may be to hold a second referendum in order to confirm that the people are still in favour of exiting the European Union. If not, we may stop the whole process."

 hold_independence_referendum_desc: "We are no longer in need of our status as a half-independent autonomous region. The people are heavily in favor of complete independence, and as their representatives, we must oblige. It's time to unilaterally hold a referendum on independence, and show the central government what our people want. According to current polling, it will pass with a substantial majority."
 reintegrate_autonomous_region: "Reintegrate §m[FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef]§!"
 reintegrate_autonomous_region_desc: "The autonomous government of [FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] is no longer capable of administrating their territory. The [FROM.GetAdjective] people are heavily against independence, and are dependent on our government for most vital infrastructure. It's time to clean up this failed nationalist experiment, and abolish the autonomous region."

 annex_puppet_state_desc: "Our puppet state of [FROM.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] lacks any real national government, and are dependent on our government for most vital infrastructure.

Using our influence in their government, we will fake a referendum and force them to apply for annexation into [ROOT.GetNonIdeologyNameDef]."

 purge_overlord_influence_desc: "The dominating influence of [ROOT.OVERLORD.GetNonIdeologyNameDef] in our government has effectively turned us into a mere puppet state, evaporating the global legitimacy of our government. Only a drastic purge of [ROOT.OVERLORD.GetAdjective] elements can rescue our nation. It will however be considered a provocation and might warrant a military response."
