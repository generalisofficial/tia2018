 GER_INFORMATION_AGE_DESC: "Unity. Justice. Freedom. These are the values on which the new German state is built. Or perhaps it is more accurate to say rebuilt. Indeed, the modern Federal Republic of Germany is a nation built upon the ashes of darker and more sinister iterations of the Vaterland. The Modern Germany stands for the unity that was robbed of it with the division of 1949 and cemented with the erection of the Berlin Wall. It stands for justice, the same that the National Socialists had denied to it’s countless victims. It stands for freedom, that flaming torch which the Führer and the General Secretary had so desperately attempted to suffocate. But these values have become evermore difficult to maintain in the Information Era as the ever-shifting political seas continue their course. As the old parties age and are increasingly seen as corrupt and incompetent, people have begun to turn to more extreme alternatives. The twin forces of Die Linke and the AfD have arisen in the East as spectres of the past, appealing to the many disaffected Germans angry that they can’t receive as good an education or the same quality of living as their western counterparts, angry that as the East gets poorer, the West gets richer. While the establishment has so far weathered the storm under the popular Angela Merkel, even this required them to band together and forge a new Grand Coalition in 2017 with the AfD serving as official opposition. Time will tell whether this is a tenable arrangement..\n\nThe 20th Century was not kind to the Vaterland. But after two devastating wars, a depression, and a 40-year division of the country Germany now stands once more as Europe’s largest economy. It stands as a champion of the European Union, and German influence is beginning to once more be felt all over the globe. But this position is by no means secure. The economic gap between the former East and West continues to grow. The Migrant Crisis has only fuelled anti-democratic sentiment, and the European Union is increasingly beset by the rising tide of populism that has swept the continent, threatening to undo the great European Experiment. Looking outwards, the Russian Bear once again threatens the continent, the Chinese Dragon seeks superpower status, and the American Eagle seems content to slowly return to isolationism. The stage is set for Germany to either gather the bickering democracies of Europe and lead them to prosperity, or watch helplessly as it becomes subject to the whims of Moscow and Beijing..\n\nWill the Vaterland endure the Information Age? Or will the dark domestic and foreign themes of the previous century once more rear their ugly heads?"
