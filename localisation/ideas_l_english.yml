The amendment is a constant cause of conflict within American politics as to its totality - with the government having successfully banned private ownership of weapons like heavy machine guns and land mines in the past, which some activists believe to be infringing upon the Second Amendment.\n\nThe Second Amendment leads to unfortunate situations where a few of the gun owners abuse their weapons to do harm, forcing the government to focus on cleaning up school shootings, hostage situations, gang crime and robberies instead of trying to bring the country forward."

Thus, its neutrality is considered less total than the one of its Swiss neighbors."

 #Belgium
 belgian_political_system: "Political System of Belgium"
 belgian_political_system_desc: "Belgium's political system is legendary for being overly complicated. The federal representative democratic constitutional monarchy of Belgium has a king as well as a central and national Belgian parliament (Brussels), a parliament for the Dutch-speaking Flemish community (Brussels), a parliament for the French-speaking Walloon community (Brussels), a parliament for the German-speaking community in the borderlands with Germany (Eupen), as well as a special designation for the officially bilingual capital city Brussels, the 'Capital Region', making Brussels the seat of three parliaments, but putting it ever so slightly out of the jurisdiction of the two regional ones and, of course, under the jurisdiction of its own Brussels parliament.\nAdd to that the subdivision into 10 provinces (not in Brussels though), 43 arrodissements and 589 municipalities and you have a thoroughly complicated and overly inefficient political system - that however succeeds in representing every single citizen sufficiently and thoroughly. Sometimes a bit too thoroughly maybe."

 #Switzerland
 swiss_political_system: "Political System of Switzerland"
 swiss_political_system_desc: "Switzerland has a very unique political system and is the only country in the world that can rightfully call itself a 'semi-direct democracy'. Citizens can change the constitution per referendum, can veto laws per referendum, can even pass laws per referendum.\nThis has implications for politicians however: Because the people make the policies either way, the Swiss coalition system has to include as many forces as possible. The four big parties of Switzerland, SVP, FDP, CVP and SP, are constantly in government together - this makes national elections in Switzerland more or less useless - as the people rule not through their representatives, but through referendums."
