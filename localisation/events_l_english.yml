Both countries continue to claim to be one true legitimate representative of China and heir to the Chinese national heritage and history. Both countries are still in frosty diplomatic relations at and times in diplomatic talks with each other, having agreed upon the 'One China principle':\n\nBoth governments agree that there is only and exactly one nation of China with a unified national identity and people and both governments agree that this exactly one nation of China has exactly one government that is legitimate.\n\nThe thing that their 'consensus' has no actual consensus on is which of the governments is the legitimate one. Both countries, in Taiwan's case sometimes depending on the ruling party, refuses to uphold diplomatic relations with a nation that upholds diplomatic relation with the other China. Due to especially the PRC's incredible international outreach and importance as a market, this is a discussion that every country MUST have a position on. We need to make a choice.\n\n(This decision will last for the next five years, after which you can choose to renew your current choice or switch to the other government.)"

Recognizing it as a country is not a no-brainer, as it would pose an immediate an lasting insult to Israel and Israel's supporters. Israel on the other hand is not recognized by dozens of - primarily muslim - UN member states as well.

 china_news.6.d:0 "In an unprecedented turn of events, it seems that the Republic of China's Kuomintang party has been approached by the People's Republic of China's diplomats. Those seemingly opposing forces do share one common interest: Keeping the ROC (Taiwan) in the Status Quo, not an indepedent nation. China claims Taiwan as part of its territory and threatens to invade if the island insists on keeping its independence indefinitely. Since the pro-independence Democratic Progressive party (DPP) won the presidency and a parliamentary majority in 2016, Beijing has ramped up pressure against Taipei on all fronts: military posturing, poaching its diplomatic allies, pushing airlines and hotels to refer to Taiwan as part of China, drastically cutting tour groups to the island and reducing agricultural imports from DPP strongholds. This all seems like a political game to weaken the DDP and keep Taiwan away from independence. Xi Jinping has been trying to build relations with the KMT and make sure that they have a parliamentary majority."

 china.2.t:0 "The Fourth Strait Crisis"
 china.2.d:0 "Chinese naval forces have crossed the line. The government of the People's Republic has began to mobilize and is pushing for reunification in the worst ways possible! It seems that a very agressive naval division has occupied one of our smaller coastal islands and planted the Chinese flag. This was obviously met with instant reaction from the other military forces on opposing islands, causing a conflict between the PLA marines and our garrison. This has been over all the news sources in China as an agression of our forces, but we all know they were the ones who occupied our rightful land. Those pesky communists have demanded the coastal islands as a tribute to this crisis, as they think it belongs to them!"

 china.4.t:0 "One Country, Two Systems Proposal"
 china.4.d:0 "The chinese government has sent a new proposal to Beijing. Their diplomats have arrived with this message that has shook and divided the nation and it seem as the only option to end the diplomatic and decades old conflict between the mainland and our island. The Chinese government has sent a proposal of a 'One country, two systems', where we would mantain our independence partially and go through a transition period between our administrations. We could still mantain capitalism after our transitional period, by their words. Should we believe them and end this conflict once and for all or should we stand strong in this island forever and wait for our opportunity to retake the mainland?"
