GitHub Policy/Information:
1. Do not commit anything that causes a CTD (Crash-to-desktop). Simple errors are fine.

2. Not committing your work and making it conflict is your own fault. When you are done with something/part of something you should always commit it, as long as it follows rule 1.

4. All code needs to follow proper indentation and quality standards.
