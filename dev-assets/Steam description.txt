[h1]The Vision[/h1]

The Information Age 2018 aims to become an immersive geopolitical simulator starting in 2018, aiming to balance sandbox and realism. The mod is heavily inspired by Geopolitical Simulator 4: Power & Revolution, and will introduce advanced political and economic mechanics, dynamic events, geographical changes, reworked graphics and more.
TIA 2018 also completely removes the national focus tree mechanic, instead aiming to replace their function with interactive mechanics, decisions, events and other gameplay functions. The focus tree mechanic is simply too linear and restrictive for what this mod is trying to become.

[h1]Notices[/h1]
[list]
[*]All features listed are currently WIP (Work In Progress), meaning that they are all subject to possible bugs and incomplete aspects.
[*]Multiplayer is currently broken due to an unknown issue. To be able to play it, simply create a save game in singleplayer and load it in multiplayer.
[*]Do not use "set_ruling_party" to change governments as that breaks the parliament and government systems. You can instead use "add_party_popularity" and hold a snap election to make your party win.
[*]The mod currently lacks starting navies. This is due to the Man the Guns update breaking the existing naval orders of battle, and due to the lack of a naval rework in the mod. Any developer able to work on this is welcome to join the team.
[*]The mod's file structure is currently not adapted to translations. Please do not attempt to translate the mod into another language than English until this issue has been resolved.
