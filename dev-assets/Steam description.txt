[h1]Compatible HOI4 Version: 1.11.4[/h1]
[h1]Compatible Languages: English[/h1]

[h1]The Vision[/h1]

The Information Age 2018 aims to become an immersive geopolitical simulator starting in 2018, aiming to balance sandbox and realism. The mod is heavily inspired by Geopolitical Simulator 4: Power & Revolution, and will introduce advanced political and economic mechanics, dynamic events, geographical changes, reworked graphics and more.
TIA 2018 also completely removes the national focus tree mechanic, instead aiming to replace their function with interactive mechanics, decisions, events and other gameplay functions. The focus tree mechanic is simply too linear and restrictive for what this mod is trying to become. TIA 2018 is a mod of innovation, meaning that we are ready to think outside the box, and embrace ideas that no other mod has ever done.

[h1]Notices[/h1]
[list]
[*]All features listed are currently WIP (Work In Progress), meaning that they are all subject to possible bugs and incomplete aspects.
[*]It is not recommended to use other mods at the same time as this one. Ask on the mod's Discord server if you want to know if a specific mod is compatible with TIA 2018.
[*]Do not use "set_ruling_party" to change governments as that breaks the parliament and government systems. You can instead use "add_party_popularity" and hold a snap election to make your party win, or use the command "event election.1" in case of a country with a presidential system.
[*]The mod currently lacks starting navies. This is due to the Man the Guns update breaking the existing naval orders of battle from Millennium Dawn Classic. Any developer able to work on naval orders of battle is welcome to join the development team.
[*]The mod's file structure is currently not adapted to translations. Please do not attempt to translate the mod into another language than English until this issue has been resolved. If that's a problem, learn English.
