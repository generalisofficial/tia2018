[h1]The Vision[/h1]

The Information Age 2018 aims to become an immersive geopolitical simulator starting in 2018, aiming to balance sandbox and realism. The mod is heavily inspired by Geopolitical Simulator 4: Power & Revolution, and will introduce advanced political and economic mechanics, dynamic events, geographical changes, reworked graphics and more.
TIA 2018 also completely removes the national focus tree mechanic, instead aiming to replace their function with interactive mechanics, decisions, events and other gameplay functions. The focus tree mechanic is simply too linear and restrictive for what this mod is trying to become. TIA 2018 is a mod of innovation, meaning that we are ready to think outside the box, and embrace ideas that no other mod has ever done.

[h1]Notices[/h1]
[list]
[*]All features listed are currently WIP (Work In Progress), meaning that they are all subject to possible bugs and incomplete aspects.
[*]It is not recommended to use other mods at the same time as this one. Ask on the mod's Discord server if you want to know if a specific mod is compatible with TIA 2018.
[*]Make sure to be using DirectX 9 in the launcher, or 3D models may start breaking or glitching.
[*]Do not use "set_ruling_party" to change governments as that breaks the parliament and government systems. You can instead use "add_party_popularity" and hold a snap election to make your party win, or use the command "event election.5".
[*]The mod's file structure is currently not adapted to translations. Please do not attempt to translate the mod into another language than English until this issue has been resolved. If that's a problem, learn English like everybody else.
[*]Credit TIA 2018 and/or Generalis if you're borrowing any of the mod's content.
[*]Feel free to create submods.
[*]Many countries currently lack starting navies. This is due to the Man the Guns update breaking the existing naval orders of battle from Millennium Dawn Classic. They are currently being worked on.
[*]The mod currently lacks starting highways in many places. Feel free to volunteer.
[*]Most country tags align with the ISO 3166-1 alpha-3 index, but for those that do not, use command "tdebug".
